# teemo.js

A library for League of Legends in node.js/iced-coffee. It supports both API functions as well as a chat client which makes connection to Riot's XMPP servers easier than before.

Refer to [examples](https://github.com/nicholastay/teemo.js/tree/master/examples) for usage of the library for now, proper README docs coming soonâ„¢.
